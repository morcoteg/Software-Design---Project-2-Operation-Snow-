CSE335 - Project 2:



Directions (in my own, brief words):

Add a snowing feature to your animation project. 

Include a final animation in the same directory as the solution file.



In class, we had step assignments, that would eventually build the base of 
our large projects. We had two large projects. We had to design heavily in the class
and implement. This is project 2, and specifically Part 2 of Project 2, which
required us to create a design to implement the snowflake feature (in a team)
and implement our design ourselves.

enjoy.
